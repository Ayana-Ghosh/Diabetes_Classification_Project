# Diabetes_Classification_Project
This project was developed during my internship at NIT Agartala under the SERB-sponsored VRITIKA internship. It focuses on "Identification of Type-2 Diabetes Biomarkers using Machine Learning/Deep Learning" to analyze and classify diabetes data for early detection of Type-2 diabetes.
