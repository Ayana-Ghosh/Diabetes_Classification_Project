# Diabetes_Classification_Project
This project was developed during my internship at NIT Agartala under the SERB-sponsored VRITIKA internship. It focuses on "Identification of Type-2 Diabetes Biomarkers using Machine Learning/Deep Learning" to analyze and classify diabetes data for early detection of Type-2 diabetes.

## Objective
To analyze and classify diabetes datasets to assist in the early detection and understanding of Type-2 diabetes.

## Models Used
- Decision Tree
- Ensembled Classifier (Combining Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and SVM in a hard voting scheme)
-  Naive Bayes

## Dataset
- uploaded along with the project

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Confusion Matrix
- Bar graphs
- Hierarchical Clustering

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn
- Keras, TensorFlow
- Jupyter Notebook
